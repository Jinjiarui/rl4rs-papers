# Paper Collection of Recommender System

This is a collection of research and review papers of reinforcement learning (RL) based recommender system techniques. Several learning-to-rank (LTR) research papers are also listed here due to high correlation. All the papers are sorted by time. **Any suggestions and pull requests are more than welcome**.

The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact [Jiarui Jin](http://Jinjiarui.github.io/) (Email: jinjiarui97 [AT] gmail.com).
